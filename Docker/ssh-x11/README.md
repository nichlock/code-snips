Barebones Dockerfile and Makefile for creating and running a docker container capable of being connected to with SSH and running X11 applications on the host machine.

Usage:

```shell
# Build and run docker container
make
# Build docker container
make build
# Run docker container
make run
# Remove the docker image (Docker container is autoremoved)
make clean
```
